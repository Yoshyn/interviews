# Backend challenge for Odnetnin

The purpose is to find a way to sort as fast as possible a set of data.

There's 3 differents algorithms solutions to solve the problem; 3 diff√©rents ways to reflect : One simple, one smart and one specific.

The solution I post here is the middle one : not fast, not slow.

FI, this can be 4 times faster by implementing the same solution in C++.

## Feeling After : 

One of the algo exercises I find very interesting for the candidate. It requires thinking about a single problem in different ways.
