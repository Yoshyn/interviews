# Backend challenge for Lanaf

The purpose is to calculate discounts based on a number of distinct products.

The difficulty is that in some cases it's not the highest discount that will generate the best price.

## Feeling After : 

Funny but too much algorithm specific. Does not enough test the candidat on important subject ( code arch, optimisation...)
